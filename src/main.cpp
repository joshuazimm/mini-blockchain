/* ---------- DIFFICULTY ----------
This is a Fixed Target Difficulty Algorithm (or Static 
Difficulty PoW). The target value is computed as: 
target=1<<(32âˆ’TARGET_BITS)

This gives a threshhold that the first 32 bit integer must
be under in order to meet the target.

Example: 1 << (32 - 25) = 1 << 7 = 128
In this case the first 32 bit integer must be less than 128
The first 24 bits of a 32 bit integer must be 0 with this
example, which comes out to 6 leading 0s in hex.

As you increase this difficulty, more leading 0s are required
to meet the target, making it more improbable, and thus 
increasing the amount of work it will take to find a solution.

/* ---------- POW MINER LOOP ----------
This loop uses SHA256 hashing implemented by open ssl. It is
important that a PoW system utilizes a one-way (irreversible) 
and deterministic hashing algorithm such that the solution can
be verified and one cannot reverse engineer the input from the
solution.

Using this hashing method, a random input must be created to
get a random output. Each cycle, this random input is hashed and
compared to the target (see difficulty section). Each iteration's
hash is different than the last because of the Nonce.

The Nonce is a value that is incremented every loop iteration
which slightly changes the input into the SHA256 algorithm.

Altogether the input is the system time that mineBlock was called
combined with the Nonce (a single string in implementation)
